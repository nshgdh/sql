IPV4- 32 bits (they separate into 4 optima bits 8+8+8+8)(DNS it is an open source)
IPV6 - 138 bite                                                   Interview based question for networking:
CIDR (Classless Inter Domain Routing):                              what is CIDR?
             formula = 2^n-2                                        CONVERTION
          to reduce the class(system) they use CIDR                 certification (CISCO)
